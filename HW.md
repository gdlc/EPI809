## HW1: Correlation and Linear Regression

**1: Correlation**
1.1. Using the [gout](https://github.com/gdlc/EPI809/blob/master/gout.txt) data set produce the following summary statistics:

   - Mean, SD, quartiles and range for serum uruate (SU) y for Age
   - A histogram of each the variables listed above.
   - A scatter plot of SU versus Age
   - Summarize in no more than three sentences your findings.
   
1.2. Report the correlation between SU and Age, p-values for two-sided and a one-sded (HA r>=0) test, and 95 and 99% CI for the correlation. For the CI report both a CI assuming normality and one Fisher's Z-transform.

**2: Linear Regression**

2.1. Using lm estimate the regression of SU on Age, report parameter estimates, SE and p-values.
2.2. Does Age has a significant effect on SU?
2.3. Explain with your own words the interpretation of each of the parameters of the model.
2.4. Report the predicted SU for individuals of 40, 50, 60, and 70 years.
2.5. Summarize your findings (no more than 3 sentences).
